# [Project Report](Semester_Project.pdf)

## This is a project for @MMSPG

### This project is the version without eyetracking and post processing. It is considered as a basic platform for conducting point cloud evaluation experiment with different protocol. 

### The eye tracking results mentioned in the report in [this folder](RecordedResults)

## Abstract

3D technologies and virtual reality have shown an increasing popularity and potential over the last decade. Different kinds of 3D content representations such as point cloud have been generated and widely used in HMDs. However, the subjective and objective quality assessment of such 3D representations in head mounted displays is still an open question. In this project, we focus on developing the platform for subjective quality assessment of point clouds using HMDs. The platform will have the following features: adjustable point representation, adjustable virtual environment, navigation in the virtual space, supporting different subjective evaluation protocols (DSIS, ACR, etc.), recording the eye interaction of the subject with the object during assessment and post-processing and generating the gaze map on the object.
